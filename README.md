# Stock Sentiment Analysis with Tweet Data

Performing sentiment analysis on stock-related tweets to classify them as either positive or negative sentiment, based on the correlation between tweet content and stock price movements.

## Overview

This Python script automates the process of collecting, processing, and analyzing tweet data related to stocks. It combines natural language processing (NLP) techniques with machine learning to determine the sentiment of each tweet, helping traders and investors gauge market sentiment.

### Features

- **Data Collection**: Collects tweets using the Twitter API, specifying relevant keywords or stock symbols.

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses the collected tweet text, including tasks like removing special characters, URLs, and stopwords.

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Employs machine learning models to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

- **Visualization**: Generates visualizations such as word clouds, sentiment distribution charts, and sentiment-over-time plots.

- **Export and Reporting**: Allows exporting the sentiment analysis results to CSV or other formats for further analysis and reporting.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Tweepy (for Twitter data collection)
- NLTK (for NLP preprocessing)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning)
- Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install tweepy nltk scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
